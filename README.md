# Cpp-Tiktoken

This is a C++ implementation of a tiktoken tokenizer library for C++. It was heavily inspired
by https://github.com/dmitry-brazhenko/SharpToken

To use, first somewhere have a lines in your project that reads something like:

        #include "tiktoken/enconding.h"

        ....

        auto encoder = GptEncoding::get_encoding(<model name>);

The value returned from this function is an `std::shared_ptr` and you will not have to manage its memory.

Supported language models that you can pass as a parameter to this function are:

        LanguageModel::O200K_BASE
        LanguageModel::CL100K_BASE 
        LanguageModel::R50K_BASE
        LanguageModel::P50K_BASE
        LanguageModel::P50K_EDIT
        LanguageModel::QWEN_BASE

After obtaining an encoder, you can then call

        auto tokens = encoder->encode(string_to_encode);

This returns a vector of the tokens for that language model.

You can decode a vector of tokens back into its original string with

        auto string_value = encoder->decode(tokens)
